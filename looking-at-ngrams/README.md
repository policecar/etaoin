## looking-at-ngrams

A visualization of n-grams as mini-graphs â€“ based on [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) 
and [force-based label placement](http://bl.ocks.org/MoritzStefaner/1377729).

### Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser (tested for Firefox Aurora 23.0a2), then use the file 
selector to load some data from disk. The data should come in the following format:

* one n-gram per line, space-separated
* the n-gram's (absolute) count as last token
* sorted alphabetically (use `$ sort filename > new_filename` if unsorted)

e.g. 

`look about oneself 3698` <br>
`take a nap 31507`
